##Overview
The prevalence of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions, making early detection and intervention critical. This project presents a novel method for estimating the risk of NAFLD by combining sophisticated machine learning techniques with anthropometric measurements acquired using computer vision technology.

##Key Points
Objective: To predict the risk of NAFLD using computer vision and machine learning based on anthropometric measurements.
Significance: Early identification of at-risk individuals allows for prompt lifestyle changes and interventions, potentially halting disease progression.

#Features
Anthropometric Measurements: Extraction of measurements such as hip circumference, waist circumference, chest circumference, etc., using computer vision.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm amongst various ML algorithms for high accuracy in predicting NAFLD risk.
Non-Invasive: Provides a non-invasive and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods like liver biopsy and blood tests.

##Tools and Libraries
Programming Language: Python.
OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
Scikit-learn for machine learning models.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
